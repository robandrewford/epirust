# epirust

A high-performance epidemiological analysis toolkit built in Rust, with bindings for Python and R. Inspired by R's `epiR`, `survival`, `epitools`, and `dagitty` packages.

## Features

- Fast and memory-safe epidemiological computations
  - SIMD vector operations (AVX2/AVX512/SSE2)
  - Parallel processing with Rayon
  - Memory-optimized data structures
  - GPU acceleration support
- Comprehensive statistical analysis
  - DAG parsing and adjustment set discovery
  - Kaplan-Meier and Cox models
  - Diagnostic accuracy stats
  - Propensity score matching
  - Disease transmission modeling
- High-performance optimizations
  - Automatic SIMD feature detection
  - Thread-safe data structures
  - Efficient memory allocation
  - Configurable data pipelines
- Python integration
  - Native PyO3 bindings
  - NumPy array support
  - Polars DataFrame integration
  - Async data loading

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Rust toolchain
- uv (Python package installer)

## Install

First, install uv if you haven't already:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install and set up the project:

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Build Rust extensions
maturin develop
```

## Development

```bash
# Run tests
pytest

# Format code
black .
ruff check .
mypy .

# Run notebooks
jupyter lab
```
